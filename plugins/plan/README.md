# `plan` Plugin Skills

A swarm of role-based agents and adversarial validation gates that drive a feature, bug fix, or refactor through a disciplined **spec → plan → execute → audit → commit** lifecycle.

These skills are designed to be used together. A single orchestrator (`starter`) dispatches the role agents in sequence, stops for human approval at defined gates, and treats files in `plans/` — not chat messages — as the single source of truth. Three *validator* skills slot in at the boundary between each phase to attack the artifact (spec, plan, or diff) before the next phase consumes it, each running a **lens-partitioned** panel whose skeptics hunt different categories from different evidence.

The swarm's structure is itself declared rather than described: [`graph.json`](graph.json) holds the nodes, edges, gates and node contracts, the lifecycle diagrams below are generated from it, and each milestone's `state.json` records where a run actually is. See [Topology & State](#topology--state).

> **Skills or subagents?** This document describes the **skills** form (invoked with the `Skill` tool). The same swarm is also packaged as **subagents** under [`agents/`](agents/README.md) — dispatched with the `Task` tool (`subagent_type`), auto-delegated from each agent's `description`, or launched with `claude --agent <name>`. The two families are kept in sync; the agents add per-role `model`, `color`, `tools`, and an `initialPrompt` bootstrap. See [`agents/README.md`](agents/README.md) for the agent-specific details.

## The Two Families

| Family | Skills | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Swarm roles** | `starter`, `product-owner` (or `visual-product-owner`), `architect` (or `visual-architect`), `engineer`, `simplifier`, `auditor`, `visual-implementation-recap` | Perform the lifecycle — discover, spec, plan, build, refine, verify, and recap the result. |
| **Adversarial validators** | `spec-validator`, `plan-validator`, `implementation-validator` | Attack each artifact at its phase boundary with an independent 3-skeptic panel; keep only findings confirmed by a 2-of-3 majority. |
| **Deliberative panels** | `spec-deliberator`, `plan-deliberator` | Improve a drafted artifact via delegates holding deliberately disjoint context (stakeholder bundles for specs, codebase/intent/delivery territories for plans) who deliberate to consensus — the generative counterpart to the validators. |

## Skill Reference

### Swarm Roles

#### 1. `starter` — The Supervisor
The Project Manager and Guardian of the Protocol. **Does no work itself**; it runs the state machine, dispatching the other agents in the correct order and enforcing the lifecycle above.

- **Owns:** protocol enforcement, artifact management, human gating, the git protocol. **The only role that runs `git commit`** — it holds both the conversation and the shell, so it is the only one that can obtain approval and then act on it.
- **Key rules:** never codes directly (delegates to `engineer`); passes *file paths*, not oral instructions; **must stop for user approval** after planning and before execution; never commits broken or unapproved code.
- **Triggers:** "be the supervisor", "orchestrate this end to end", "run the swarm", "drive this from idea to commit", or resuming a milestone in `plans/active_milestones/`.

#### 2. `product-owner` — The Product Owner
Translates raw, ambiguous human ideas into rigorous, testable specifications, and owns the master roadmap.

- **Produces:** `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/spec.md` (with Gherkin `Given/When/Then` acceptance criteria) and updates `plans/00-ROADMAP.md`.
- **Signature move — the "Grill Loop":** interrogates the user (≤3 Socratic questions at a time) about edge cases, limits, error states, and UX until ambiguity is resolved. No clear acceptance criteria → not a spec.
- **Constraints:** writes no code and no architecture — defines *what* and *why*, never *how*; never guesses an unspecified edge case.

#### 2·alt. `visual-product-owner` — The Visual Product Owner (Spec author + Renderer)
A **drop-in alternative to `product-owner`** for specs that deserve a human-optimized review surface. Runs the identical Grill Loop and writes the same `spec.md`, then renders that spec as a self-contained, browsable HTML document.

- **Produces:** the same `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/spec.md` (structure-identical, so `spec-validator`/`architect` consume it unchanged) and the same `plans/00-ROADMAP.md` update **plus** `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/visual-spec.html`.
- **The visual file:** a single, zero-build HTML page (opens via `file://`) with eight spec-native surfaces — overview, user-story cards, color-coded Given/When/Then acceptance criteria, user-flow diagrams, edge-cases/constraints, wireframes/prototype, open questions, and author comments. Diagrams use Mermaid + a raw-source fallback; both via pinned CDN with SRI.
- **Use it instead of `product-owner`** at the Phase-1 spec step when the spec review benefits from visuals (UX-heavy or acceptance-criteria-dense work). The HTML is a **derived view** of `spec.md` — if they disagree, `spec.md` wins.
- **Constraints:** same as `product-owner` (no code, no architecture, no guessing) plus: must always still emit `spec.md`; self-contained single file; the visual shows *what & why* only (no file maps, code, or system internals — those are the Architect's); comments are static author callouts, not a live system.

#### 3. `architect` — The Chief Software Architect (Planner)
Reads the spec, investigates the actual codebase, and produces a detailed, micro-stepped implementation plan. **Read-only on source code.**

- **Produces:** `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/plan.md` (optionally `data-model.md` / `api-contracts.md`).
- **Plan shape:** tasks grouped into **parallel execution groups** (tasks in a group must touch independent files); every task includes a test/"characterize behavior" step before any refactor — *"if there is no test, there is no refactoring."*
- **Constraints:** never edits source; never commits; verification steps must name exact commands, not "ensure it works".

#### 3·alt. `visual-architect` — The Visual Architect (Planner + Renderer)
A **drop-in alternative to `architect`** for plans that deserve a human-optimized review surface. Does the identical planning work, then renders the plan as a self-contained, browsable HTML document.

- **Produces:** the same `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/plan.md` (structure-identical, so `plan-validator`/`engineer`/`auditor` consume it unchanged) **plus** `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/visual-plan.html`.
- **The visual file:** a single, zero-build HTML page (opens via `file://`) with nine surfaces — overview, architecture diagrams, file map, annotated code, OpenAPI-style API cards, schema map, wireframes/prototype, open questions, and author comments. Diagrams use Mermaid + a raw-source fallback; code uses highlight.js; both via pinned CDN with SRI.
- **Use it instead of `architect`** at the Phase-2 planning step when the human review gate benefits from visuals (architecture-heavy or ambiguous work). The HTML is a **derived view** of `plan.md` — if they disagree, `plan.md` wins.
- **Constraints:** same as `architect` (read-only source, never commits) plus: must always still emit `plan.md`; self-contained single file; comments are static author callouts, not a live system.

#### 4. `engineer` — The Expert Builder
Implements the plan exactly, one atomic step at a time, under strict Test-Driven Development.

- **Doctrine:** no untested changes; Red → Green → Refactor; characterization tests + seams for legacy code (Feathers); strict scope — implement the assigned task and nothing more.
- **Tracks progress** by checking off todos directly in `plan.md`; uses `git mv` to preserve history.
- **Constraints:** strict scope — no unrequested refactors or features; no plan → no code; never hands off a broken build; never commits.

#### 5. `simplifier` — The Refiner
Improves clarity, consistency, and maintainability of existing code **with zero behavioral change**.

- **Focus:** reduce nesting and cognitive load, explicit naming, early returns — matching the surrounding code's idiom, naming, and comment density rather than an external style guide.
- **Constraints:** zero-regression — never alters business logic, fixes unrelated bugs, or adds features. Use when asked to "simplify", "refactor for clarity", or "clean up this file".

#### 6. `auditor` — The Quality Gatekeeper (Verifier)
Skeptically verifies the engineer's work against the plan, with evidence. It never fixes code and never commits — its passing report is what unblocks the `starter`'s commit gate.

- **Verifies:** evidence-based static checks (cite `file:lines`), dynamic build + test runs, and **anti-shortcut detection** (hunts for `TODO`/`FIXME`/placeholders, deferred-work comments, skipped or gutted tests, fake/hardcoded implementations).
- **Produces:** a formal report at `plans/audit/AUDIT_[Plan_Name].md`.
- **Constraints:** never fixes code (reports only, hands fixes back to the engineer); no new capability without tests = automatic FAIL; **never commits** — it has no user-facing turn, so it cannot obtain the approval a commit requires; the report goes back to `starter`.

#### 7. `visual-implementation-recap` — The Implementation Recap (Renderer)
An **additive** renderer — **not** a drop-in replacement for any role, and never a substitute for the audit. After the engineer implements `plan.md` and the auditor returns a green audit, it renders everything the milestone changed into a self-contained, browsable HTML document for the human commit gate.

- **Produces:** `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/visual-recap.html` (purely additive — nothing else in the swarm changes).
- **The visual file:** a single, zero-build HTML page (opens via `file://`) with nine recap surfaces — overview + metrics, tasks completed, a changed-files tree with diffstat, annotated diffs (the centerpiece), architecture, API & schema changes, before/after UI, the audit verdict with evidence, and author notes. Diffs render with pure CSS; diagrams use Mermaid + a raw-source fallback; both libraries load via pinned CDN with SRI.
- **Grounded & read-only:** every diff line, file, and stat is taken verbatim from the real `git diff` + `plan.md` + the audit report (`AUDIT_[Plan_Name].md`) — true by construction, never invented; secrets are redacted; clipped diffs say so. Read-only on source; **never commits** (that stays the auditor's job after approval).
- **Use it** at the commit gate, after a green audit, when the reviewer benefits from seeing the whole change at altitude rather than prose plus a raw diff.

### Deliberative Panel

#### `spec-deliberator` — Deliberate the Spec
Runs **after a spec is drafted, before `spec-validator`**, when the spec depends on knowledge siloed across stakeholders, docs, or repos. The structural inverse of the validators: delegates get *disjoint* context bundles (validators get identical full context), communication is the mechanism (validators forbid it), and the output is consensus on one revised spec (not a majority vote on findings).

- **Machinery:** 3 delegates (product · engineering · ops/security by default), each seeded with a private context bundle passing the **asymmetry test** (name a fact only that delegate knows that could change the spec — or fall back to centralized revision, which beats a clone panel). Sequential turns relayed **verbatim** by the orchestrator, same agents continued across rounds, hard cap 4 rounds. Acceptance must be *earned* — each accepting delegate states what it verified or what changed its mind, the guard against round-1 sycophancy.
- **Output:** the revised `spec.md` plus a deliberation record at `deliberations/spec-deliberation.md` (bundles, disclosures, edits with rationale, disputes, round log). Hard-constraint disputes escalate to the user; the revised spec still goes through `spec-validator`.
- **Hybrid:** a 2-delegate mini-panel over a validator run's *single-vote findings* adjudicates exactly where independent judgment ran out.

#### `plan-deliberator` — Deliberate the Plan
Runs **after a plan is drafted, before `plan-validator`**, when the plan spans more territory — spec intent, multiple subsystems, the delivery pipeline — than one agent can deep-read at once, or leaves a trade-off open. Where the validator predicts failure of a fixed plan, the deliberator **reshapes** it and **decides trade-offs** (migration strategy, group boundaries, scope) with each territory's constraints on the record — the one thing a vote structurally cannot produce.

- **Machinery:** 3 delegates (intent · codebase · delivery by default; split codebase by subsystem rather than adding role types), asymmetry engineered by **assigned investigation** — each delegate deep-reads only its territory and is the panel's sole authority on it. Every claim must cite its territory (`file:line`, spec clause, or CI command); sequential verbatim-relayed turns, same agents continued via SendMessage, hard cap 4 rounds, acceptance requires a stated basis.
- **Output:** the revised `plan.md` (structure preserved: parallel groups, test-first steps) plus a deliberation record at `deliberations/plan-deliberation.md` — territories, cited disclosures, trade-offs decided, edits with rationale, disputes, round log. Hard-evidence disputes escalate to the user; the revised plan still faces `plan-validator`.
- **Hybrid:** a 2-delegate mini-panel over a `plan-validator` run's single-vote tail → `deliberations/plan-deliberation-tail.md`.

### Adversarial Validators

All three share the same machinery: dispatch **3 lens-partitioned skeptic agents in parallel** (no shared scratchpad), each framed to *break* the artifact with a **default-to-reject** posture, then keep only findings confirmed by a **2-of-3 majority** (1-vote findings go to a **Single-Vote Findings (triage required)** section, never silently dropped).

**The three skeptics are not given the same prompt.** Each owns a different slice of the attack surface *and* a different reading assignment — for the plan panel: the step graph, the source files the plan names, and the callers/tests/CI it disturbs. Three identical prompts on one model produce correlated errors: the panel is shaped like three votes and carries close to one, so a "2-of-3 majority" becomes one opinion counted twice. Each panel's `references/skeptic-prompt.md` therefore ships a shared preamble, three lens sections, and a shared tail, and every panel run must first pass the **asymmetry test** — name one finding only that lens could reach; if you cannot, merge it and run two.

Each skeptic returns a single fenced JSON block tagged with its `lens`; the orchestrator dedups by a stable kebab-case `id` before tallying, and records **which lenses agreed**. `cross_lens` agreement — two lenses reaching one finding from different evidence — is independent corroboration and ranks above same-lens repetition. The gate is tunable: drop to **any-one** for high-stakes work, raise to **unanimous** when re-work is costly. Every panel then writes a **human-readable Markdown report** to `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/adversarial-reviews/{stage}-validation.md` — written on every run (even a clean pass), with re-runs preserved as `-r2`/`-r3` — so the verdict is browsable without opening an agent transcript.

#### 8. `spec-validator` — Attack the Spec
Runs **after a spec is drafted, before a plan is written** — defects are cheapest to fix here.

- **Attack surface:** ambiguity, missing requirements (errors, empty/huge inputs, concurrency, auth, limits, units, time), contradictions, untestable acceptance criteria, and *malicious compliance* (the laziest implementation that passes every criterion yet is useless).
- **Output:** confirmed findings each carry a `tightening` — a concrete reworded/added requirement to fold back into the spec.

#### 8·alt. `geap-spec-validator` — Attack the Spec, Remotely
A **drop-in alternative to `spec-validator`** whose skeptics are **remote Vertex AI foundation models** (any mix of `gemini-*` / `claude-*`, configurable) instead of local subagents — one Python script runs 3 skeptics in parallel plus a **synthesis model** that consolidates findings and casts an extra validation vote (quorum: ≥ 2 of 4 votes, counted programmatically).

- **Use it instead of `spec-validator`** when the review benefits from model diversity (non-Claude opinions) or an externally-produced audit trail; requires GCP ADC (`gcloud auth application-default login`).
- **Output:** `adversarial-reviews/geap-spec-validation.md` in the same milestone folder; exit code 0 = pass, 1 = confirmed findings.

#### 8·alt2. `geap-interactions-spec-validator` — Attack the Spec, Remotely, No Python
The **no-Python sibling of `geap-spec-validator`**: the same remote skeptic panel (configurable roster of `gemini-*`/`claude-*` models + synthesis vote), but transport is `curl` to the **Interactions API** with ADC — executed by `geap-interactions-caller` subagents, one per skeptic, with automatic per-call fallback to the Vertex AI global endpoint. The orchestrating agent counts the votes (≥ 2 of N+1).

- **Use it instead of `geap-spec-validator`** when no venv/Python is available or wanted; requires only `gcloud` ADC + `jq`.
- **Output:** `adversarial-reviews/geap-interactions-spec-validation.md` in the same milestone folder, including a per-model Transport row.

#### 9. `plan-validator` — Attack the Plan
Runs **after a plan is written, before execution**. Unlike spec skeptics, these **read the codebase** to check the plan's assumptions against reality.

- **Attack surface:** ordering/dependency bugs ("step 4 edits what step 2 forgot to create"), false assumptions about existing code (a named function/field/signature that doesn't exist — *open the file and check*), unverifiable "verify" steps, missing rollback, missing migration/compat, hidden coupling.
- **Output:** each finding cites `file:line` evidence and a `fix`; the panel names the **`first_domino`** — the earliest failure that invalidates later steps.

#### 9·alt. `geap-plan-validator` — Attack the Plan, Remotely
A **drop-in alternative to `plan-validator`** running the panel on **remote Vertex AI foundation models** (3 configurable skeptics — Dependency & Ordering, Hidden-Assumption, Integration & Failure-Mode — plus a synthesis model that also nominates the `first_domino`).

- **Scope caveat:** remote skeptics **cannot read the repository** — they attack the plan text only (evidence = verbatim plan quotes; unverifiable code assumptions are flagged `false-assumption`/low-confidence). For codebase-verified review, use the local `plan-validator`; the two are complementary.
- **Output:** `adversarial-reviews/geap-plan-validation.md` in the same milestone folder; exit code 0 = pass, 1 = confirmed findings.

#### 9·alt2. `geap-interactions-plan-validator` — Attack the Plan, Remotely, No Python
The **no-Python sibling of `geap-plan-validator`**: same remote panel and `first_domino` nomination, transport via `curl` to the **Interactions API** with ADC (per-call Vertex fallback), one caller subagent per skeptic, votes counted by the orchestrating agent.

- **Scope caveat:** identical to `geap-plan-validator` — remote skeptics attack the plan text only.
- **Output:** `adversarial-reviews/geap-interactions-plan-validation.md` in the same milestone folder, including a per-model Transport row.

#### 10. `implementation-validator` — Attack the Diff
Runs **after code is written, before merge**. Reasons about the code (it does *not* launch the app).

- **Two modes:** *finding-hunt* (default — hunt the diff for defects, default `isReal=false`) and *claim-refutation* (try to refute explicit acceptance claims, default `refuted=true`).
- **Attack surface:** claim vs. reality, broken/swallowed failure paths, edge cases, concurrency races, resource/correctness, regressions.
- **Signature output — severity calibration:** the panel's most valuable product isn't deletion but *corrected severity* (e.g. three reviewers call a singleton race "Critical"; it's confirmed real but downgraded to "High" because impact is gated on concurrent requests). Always surface the calibration delta.

### Utility

#### `teamwork-trajectory` — Visualize the Swarm
An out-of-band **utility** skill (not part of the lifecycle) that scans the `.agents/` directory, parses each agent's briefing and hand-off records, and compiles an interactive, dark-mode HTML timeline of everything the swarm executed.

- **Produces:** `.agents/trajectory.html` (self-contained, browsable).
- **Triggers:** "generate trajectory", "visualize teamwork", "trace agents", "update trajectory dashboard".

## Artifact Map

The swarm communicates through files under `plans/`. Knowing this layout is the fastest way to understand any in-flight milestone.

| Path | Written by | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `plans/research/*.md` | Phase 0 investigator | Context report: affected domain, existing patterns, constraints. |
| `plans/00-ROADMAP.md` | `product-owner` | Master roadmap — releases, milestones, and their status. |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/context.md` | `product-owner` | The context report, moved in once the milestone is opened. |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/state.json` | `starter` | The run's declared state — phase, gate decisions, per-node status and reports, per-group task and commit status. `starter` **reads** this to resume rather than inferring the phase from which files exist. Schema: [`lib/graph/STATE.md`](lib/graph/STATE.md). |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/spec.md` | `product-owner` | The specification (Gherkin acceptance criteria). |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/visual-spec.html` | `visual-product-owner` | Self-contained, browsable companion to `spec.md` for spec review (zero build; opens in any browser). |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/deliberations/{spec,plan}-deliberation.md` | `spec-deliberator` · `plan-deliberator` | Deliberation record — panel & private bundles/territories, key disclosures (cited), trade-offs decided, applied edits with rationale and acceptance bases, disputes (converged/arbitrated/escalated), round log. Written every run, even on "no changes"; re-runs append `-r2`; the hybrid tail-panel writes `-tail`. |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/plan.md` | `architect` | Micro-stepped plan with parallel execution groups; engineer checks off todos here. |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/data-model.md` · `api-contracts.md` | `architect` | Optional supporting design artifacts. |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/visual-plan.html` | `visual-architect` | Self-contained, browsable companion to `plan.md` for the human review gate (zero build; opens in any browser). |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/adversarial-reviews/{spec,plan,implementation}-validation.md` | `spec-validator` · `plan-validator` · `implementation-validator` | Human-readable Markdown report from each skeptic panel — verdict, confirmed findings (with `file:line` evidence and fixes), the single-vote tail for triage, and (for implementation) the severity-calibration table. Written every run, even on a clean pass; re-runs append `-r2`, `-r3`. |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/adversarial-reviews/geap-{spec,plan}-validation.md` | `geap-spec-validator` · `geap-plan-validator` | Report from the **remote** Vertex AI panel (3 configurable skeptic models + synthesis vote) — same review-document shape as the local validators, plus the models used and the 2-of-4 vote tally per finding. |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/adversarial-reviews/geap-interactions-{spec,plan}-validation.md` | `geap-interactions-spec-validator` · `geap-interactions-plan-validator` | Report from the **no-Python** remote panel (Interactions API via curl/ADC, Vertex fallback) — same shape as the geap reports plus per-model transport and a Panel Health section. |
| `plans/audit/AUDIT_[Plan_Name].md` | `auditor` | Evidence-based audit report (the `plans/audit/` dir is git-ignored). |
| `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/visual-recap.html` | `visual-implementation-recap` | Self-contained, browsable recap of everything the milestone changed — diffstat, annotated diffs, task/audit status — for the human commit gate (zero build; opens in any browser). |

## Topology & State

Two files make the swarm's structure explicit rather than remembered.

### `graph.json` — the topology

Every node, edge, gate and node contract in one declaration: which nodes exist, what routes
between them and under what condition, which panels are lens-partitioned and into which
lenses, and what each node is allowed to read and write. **The lifecycle diagrams in this
README and in [`agents/README.md`](agents/README.md) are generated from it** — they are not
maintained by hand, because three hand-maintained copies of one topology is how the
documented lifecycle and the dispatching state machine drifted apart in the first place.

```bash
python3 lib/graph/graph.py validate       # topology vs. the skills on disk
python3 lib/graph/graph.py render ascii   # the lifecycle diagram
python3 lib/graph/graph.py render mermaid # the same graph, for docs
python3 lib/graph/graph.py sync           # rewrite the generated blocks in both READMEs
python3 lib/graph/graph.py sync --check   # non-zero exit if a README is stale (CI)
```

`validate` is not decorative. It fails when a declared skill or agent is missing from disk,
when an edge points at a node that does not exist, when a node is unreachable, when a node
declares it writes repository source or commits without the authority to, when a panel's
declared lens count disagrees with its prompt file — and specifically when a panel's prompt
file has reverted to dispatching identical skeptics, which is the defect the lens partition
exists to prevent.

### `state.json` — the declared state

Per milestone, at `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/state.json`. The artifacts under
`plans/` remain the payload; this file is the index over them, recording the phase, each
gate's decision, each node's status and report, and each group's tasks and commit SHA. It
exists so `starter` can **read** where a run is instead of inferring it from which files
happen to be present — an inference in which a validator that ran and failed looks exactly
like one that never ran. A skipped gate is recorded as skipped, with a reason; an unrecorded
skip is indistinguishable from a pass. Full schema and field semantics:
[`lib/graph/STATE.md`](lib/graph/STATE.md).

## How They Work Together

A typical end-to-end run:

1. **`starter`** receives the request and dispatches a codebase investigation → `plans/research/`.
2. **`product-owner`** reads the context report, runs the Grill Loop, and writes `spec.md` + roadmap entry.
   - *(optional)* **`spec-deliberator`** convenes a delegate panel with disjoint context bundles to enrich the spec with siloed constraints before it faces the gate.
3. **`spec-validator`** attacks the spec with three lens-partitioned skeptics (internal-consistency · missing-requirement · malicious-compliance); confirmed `tightening`s are folded back in, and the single-vote tail is triaged rather than dropped.
4. **`architect`** investigates the code and writes `plan.md` with parallel groups.
   - *(optional)* **`plan-deliberator`** convenes a territory panel (intent · codebase · delivery) to reshape the plan and decide open trade-offs with cited evidence before it faces the gate.
5. **`plan-validator`** attacks the plan against the real codebase with three lens-partitioned skeptics (sequencing · ground-truth · blast-radius, each reading different evidence); the `first_domino` and confirmed fixes are applied (reorder steps, add prerequisites, correct assumptions).
6. **🛑 Human review gate** — the user reviews `spec.md` + `plan.md` and types "approve".
7. **`engineer`** (up to ~4 in parallel per group) implements each group under TDD; **`simplifier`** optionally refines; **`auditor`** verifies each group and writes an audit report.
8. **`implementation-validator`** attacks the diff before merge with three lens-partitioned skeptics (claim-vs-reality · failure-paths · blast-radius); confirmed defects are fixed at their *calibrated* severity, and cross-lens agreement ranks above same-lens repetition.
9. **🛑 Commit gate** — `visual-implementation-recap` renders `visual-recap.html` so the human can review every change at altitude; commit only on a green audit **and** explicit user approval.
10. **`product-owner`** marks the release "Shipped" and activates the next.

Throughout, `starter` records each transition, gate decision and node verdict in the milestone's `state.json`, so a resumed run reads its phase instead of guessing it.

## Invoking a Skill

These are Claude Code skills. Invoke one with the **`Skill`** tool (e.g. `plan:starter`), or let it activate from the triggers in each skill's `description`. The natural entry point for an end-to-end run is **`starter`** ("be the supervisor", "run the swarm"); the role and validator skills can also be invoked standalone for a single phase (e.g. "validate this spec" → `spec-validator`, "simplify this file" → `simplifier`).
