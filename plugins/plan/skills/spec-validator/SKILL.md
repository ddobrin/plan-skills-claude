# Adversarial Spec Validation

## Overview

Dispatch a panel of independent **skeptic** agents whose only job is to break a spec
*before* anyone writes a plan or code against it. At spec stage there is no code to test,
so the attack surface is the **language of the spec itself**: ambiguity, gaps,
contradictions, and acceptance criteria that cannot actually be verified.

A skeptic plays the role of a hostile or careless implementer who will satisfy the
*letter* of the spec while violating its *intent*. Anything they can twist is a defect
in the spec, not the implementer.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the spec-validator skill to attack this spec with an independent skeptic panel."

## When to Use

- A spec / design doc exists (spec.md) and you are about to write an implementation plan.
- The user asks to "validate", "stress-test", "poke holes in", or "review" a spec or design.
- You are the author and want an independent perspective uncontaminated by your own reasoning.

## When NOT to Use

- There is no written spec yet — brainstorm first.
- The artifact is a plan (use `plan-validator`) or code (use `implementation-validator`).
- A one-line, unambiguous change where the spec is a single sentence — overhead exceeds benefit.

## Core Principle

Four things turn an ordinary review into adversarial findings. All four are required:

1. **Adversarial framing** — the agent's success metric is "how many real holes did I find," not "is this good." It is told to *break* the spec, not evaluate it.
2. **Default-to-reject** — uncertainty resolves *against* the spec. Returning "looks complete" is a failed review unless the agent lists what it attacked and why each attack failed.
3. **Partitioned lenses** — the three skeptics are **not** given the same prompt. Each owns a different slice of the attack surface *and* a different reading assignment (the spec against itself · the world outside the spec · the acceptance criteria alone, read as a contract to game). Three identical prompts on one model produce correlated errors: the panel is shaped like three votes and carries close to one.
4. **Independent quorum** — the lenses never see each other's output; keep only findings confirmed by a **majority (2 of 3)**, and rank **cross-lens** agreement above same-lens repetition.

Never tell a skeptic to be conservative or to report only what matters. A review prompt
that asks for restraint gets restraint: the model reports *less*, and what it drops is not
reliably the noise. Recall is the skeptic's job; precision is the gate's.

## Attack Surface (what each skeptic hunts for)

- **Ambiguity** — a requirement that can be read two ways; pick the worse reading and show the harm.
- **Missing requirements** — error behavior, empty/null/huge inputs, concurrency/ordering, auth, limits, units, time zones.
- **Contradictions** — two sections that cannot both be satisfied; the architecture not matching the feature description.
- **Untestable acceptance criteria** — "fast", "robust", "user-friendly" with no measurable threshold.
- **Malicious compliance** — the laziest implementation that passes every stated criterion yet is useless.

## Process

### 1. Gather inputs
- The spec text (paste it into each prompt, or give an absolute path the agents can read).
- Any context the spec depends on but does not restate (linked docs, constraints).

### 2. Author the skeptic prompt
Fill the template in `references/skeptic-prompt.md`, which also carries the aggregation
**Output Contract**.

### 3. Run the asymmetry test, then dispatch one skeptic per lens
Before dispatching, name one hole **only that lens could find** — lens 2 is the only one
looking outside the document; lens 3 is the only one that never reads the prose rationale.
If you cannot name one for a lens (typically because there is no context report and lens 2
has nothing external to read), merge it and run two.

Then make **three `Agent` calls in a single message**, one per lens from
`references/skeptic-prompt.md` (Internal Consistency · Missing Requirement · Malicious
Compliance), so they run concurrently and independently. Use
`subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (or `"Explore"` if the spec lives in files they must
read). Do **not** let them share a scratchpad — independence is what makes the vote mean
something.

> **Panel cost.** Review accuracy holds up well below the top model tier, so a routine
> pre-planning gate does not need the most expensive panel you can build — pass
> `model: "sonnet"` for the skeptics and reserve the default for a security-sensitive spec
> or a re-run after a material rewrite. A panel cheap enough to run every time beats a
> thorough one that gets skipped. (In a `Workflow` script, the same lever is
> `effort: "low"` / `"medium"` on `agent()`; the `Agent` tool exposes `model` only.)

### 4. Collect verdicts
Each agent's final message is a fenced JSON block. Parse all three. If an agent returns
prose instead of JSON, re-dispatch that one — do not hand-guess its findings.

### 5. Dedup by identity
Three skeptics will phrase the same hole three different ways. Group findings by a **stable
identity**, not by exact wording: `id` (a kebab-case slug each agent assigns) plus the
quoted `clause`. If you tally on raw text you get three 1-vote findings and nothing reaches
quorum.

### 6. Apply the majority gate
- **Confirmed:** appears in **≥ 2 of 3** outputs.
- **Cross-lens vs. same-lens.** Record *which lenses* agreed. Two lenses reaching one
  finding from different evidence is independent corroboration and ranks first. A
  finding both raised by lenses that read the same material is weaker than its vote
  count suggests — read the evidence, not the tally.
- **Single vote:** appears in exactly one. These go to the **Single-Vote Findings (triage
  required)** section and each one needs an explicit decision — tightened, accepted as
  intended behavior, or refuted with a reason. A lone finding from a current-generation
  skeptic is more often a real hole one reviewer happened to reach than noise, so "only one
  agent saw it" is not a reason to close it. Spec holes are the cheapest defects in the
  lifecycle to fix and the most expensive to discover later.
- Severity: most common among agreeing skeptics; tie → higher.

> **Tuning the gate:** 2-of-3 is the default. For a high-stakes or security-sensitive spec, drop to **any-one** (1 of 3) for maximum recall and triage the tail yourself. When fix-churn is expensive, raise to **unanimous** (3 of 3).

### 7. Persist the review
Write the aggregated result as a Markdown report to
`plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/adversarial-reviews/spec-validation.md` (create the
folder if it does not exist). Derive `{moniker}` from the spec's path — the spec you
reviewed lives at `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/spec.md`; if you were handed a bare
spec with no milestone, write to `plans/adversarial-reviews/spec-validation.md` and say so.
**Always write this file, even on a clean pass** — "zero confirmed findings, here is what
was attacked" is itself the evidence the gate produced. A re-run after a material revision
goes to `spec-validation-r2.md`, `-r3.md`, … so every round is preserved for comparison.

Fill the template in `references/review-template.md`. See `references/worked-example.md`
for a complete run.

### 8. Act
- For each **confirmed** finding, apply its `tightening` to the spec (or surface it to the user if it changes intent).
- **Triage every single-vote finding** and record the decision in the review.
- If you rewrote the spec materially, re-run the panel once on the revision.
- Tick the **Actions Taken** checklist in the review file as you apply each fix.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Three identical prompts give me three independent opinions." | They give one opinion sampled three times. Correlated skeptics manufacture false corroboration — partition the lens *and* the reading assignment. |
| "The spec looks thorough, one skeptic is enough." | One agent trends toward agreement. The vote needs ≥3 independent runs. |
| "I'll let the three agents collaborate." | Shared context collapses them toward consensus; the vote becomes meaningless. |
| "Only 1 skeptic flagged it, so ignore it." | Wrong default. Modern skeptics are precise; the lone finding is usually real. Triage it and record the decision. |
| "I'll tell them to only report the serious stuff." | The model will comply and report less. Ask for everything; filter at the gate. |
| "I'll paraphrase their findings together." | Dedup on stable `id` + quoted clause, not by re-summarizing — or real holes vanish in the merge. |
| "An agent returned prose, I'll interpret it." | Re-dispatch for valid JSON. Don't guess the contract. |

## Calibration Note

The quorum's value is not only deletion. Skeptics frequently *over*-rate severity under
adversarial framing. When agreeing skeptics disagree on severity, the aggregation step is
doing real work: a hole two reviewers call "high" and one calls "medium" lands at high,
but the spread itself tells you the finding is real and the impact is debatable — worth a
sentence to the user rather than a silent edit.

Note what the quorum is and is not for. It is a *ranking* device — it tells you which
findings two independent readers reached, and those go first. It is not a filter that makes
the rest disappear. Read the evidence, not the vote count.
