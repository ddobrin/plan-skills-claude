description: Use after a spec or design doc is drafted and BEFORE writing an implementation plan, to find defects while they are still cheap to fix. Dispatches independent skeptic agents that attack the spec for ambiguity, missing or contradictory requirements, and untestable acceptance criteria, then keeps only findings confirmed by a 2-of-3 majority. Symptoms - "validate this spec", "poke holes in this design", "is this spec ready to plan against", finishing the product-owner grill loop before architect, a freshly written plans/active_milestones/*/spec.md.

# Adversarial Spec Validation

## Overview

Dispatch a panel of independent **skeptic** agents whose only job is to break a spec
*before* anyone writes a plan or code against it. At spec stage there is no code to test,
so the attack surface is the **language of the spec itself**: ambiguity, gaps,
contradictions, and acceptance criteria that cannot actually be verified.

A skeptic plays the role of a hostile or careless implementer who will satisfy the
*letter* of the spec while violating its *intent*. Anything they can twist is a defect
in the spec, not the implementer.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the spec-validator skill to attack this spec with an independent skeptic panel."

## When to Use

- A spec / design doc exists (spec.md) and you are about to write an implementation plan.
- The user asks to "validate", "stress-test", "poke holes in", or "review" a spec or design.
- You are the author and want an independent perspective uncontaminated by your own reasoning.

## When NOT to Use

- There is no written spec yet — brainstorm first.
- The artifact is a plan (use `plan-validator`) or code (use `implementation-validator`).
- A one-line, unambiguous change where the spec is a single sentence — overhead exceeds benefit.

## Core Principle

Three things turn an ordinary review into adversarial findings. All three are required:

1. **Adversarial framing** — the agent's success metric is "how many real holes did I find," not "is this good." It is told to *break* the spec, not evaluate it.
2. **Default-to-reject** — uncertainty resolves *against* the spec. Returning "looks complete" is a failed review unless the agent lists what it attacked and why each attack failed.
3. **Independent quorum** — run **N = 3** skeptics that never see each other's output, then keep only findings confirmed by a **majority (2 of 3)**.

Aggressive framing raises *recall* (catches more real holes) but lowers *precision*
(more noise). The majority quorum restores precision. One without the other is a bad trade.

## Attack Surface (what each skeptic hunts for)

- **Ambiguity** — a requirement that can be read two ways; pick the worse reading and show the harm.
- **Missing requirements** — error behavior, empty/null/huge inputs, concurrency/ordering, auth, limits, units, time zones.
- **Contradictions** — two sections that cannot both be satisfied; the architecture not matching the feature description.
- **Untestable acceptance criteria** — "fast", "robust", "user-friendly" with no measurable threshold.
- **Malicious compliance** — the laziest implementation that passes every stated criterion yet is useless.

## Process

### 1. Gather inputs
- The spec text (paste it into each prompt, or give an absolute path the agents can read).
- Any context the spec depends on but does not restate (linked docs, constraints).

### 2. Author the skeptic prompt
Fill the template in **Skeptic Prompt Template** below. Keep the framing verbatim — the
"default to reject" and "your final message MUST be JSON" clauses are load-bearing.

### 3. Dispatch 3 skeptics in parallel
Make **three `Agent` calls in a single message** so they run concurrently and independently.
Use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`; it can read the spec from a path.
Do **not** let them share a scratchpad — independence is what makes the vote mean something.

### 4. Collect verdicts
Each agent's final message is a fenced JSON block (see **Output Contract**). Parse all three.
If an agent returns prose instead of JSON, re-dispatch that one — do not hand-guess its findings.

### 5–6. Dedup and gate
Save each skeptic's JSON to a file. Skeptics phrase the same hole differently and
`tally.py` groups on the exact `id`, so first reconcile ids: where two verdicts describe
the same hole (same clause, same malicious reading) under different slugs, rewrite them to
one canonical `id` in the saved files and record each remapping for the review. Merge only
true duplicates; distinct holes in the same clause keep separate ids. Then run
`python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/tally.py --gate 2 s1.json s2.json s3.json`.
It counts votes per `id` and picks the majority severity (tie → higher). Read the
confirmed and unconfirmed lists from its output rather than counting yourself.
Use `--gate 1` for high-stakes or security-sensitive artifacts and `--gate 3` when
fix-churn is expensive.

### 7. Persist the review
Write the aggregated result as a Markdown report to
`plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/adversarial-reviews/spec-validation.md` (create the
folder if it does not exist). Derive `{moniker}` from the spec's path — the spec you
reviewed lives at `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/spec.md`; if you were handed a bare
spec with no milestone, write to `plans/adversarial-reviews/spec-validation.md` and say so.
**Always write this file, even on a clean pass** — "zero confirmed findings, here is what
was attacked" is itself the evidence the gate produced. A re-run after a material revision
goes to `spec-validation-r2.md`, `-r3.md`, … so every round is preserved for comparison.
Fill the **The Review Document** template below verbatim.

### 8. Act
- For each **confirmed** finding, apply its `tightening` to the spec (or surface it to the user if it changes intent).
- List **unconfirmed** findings so the user can eyeball the tail.
- If you rewrote the spec materially, re-run the panel once on the revision.
- Tick the **Actions Taken** checklist in the review file as you apply each fix.

## Skeptic Prompt Template

Dispatch this **three times, unchanged**, via the `Agent` tool. Replace only `{SPEC}`
(and `{CONTEXT}` if any).

```
You are an adversarial spec reviewer. You will implement this spec as literally and
lazily as a hostile or careless engineer could. Your goal is to find every way the
letter of this spec can be satisfied while its intent is violated, and every place it
is ambiguous, incomplete, contradictory, or untestable.

SPEC:
{SPEC}

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (constraints the spec relies on but may not restate):
{CONTEXT}

Attack the spec across these categories:
- Ambiguity: a requirement readable two ways — pick the damaging reading.
- Missing requirements: error behavior, empty/null/huge inputs, concurrency and
  ordering, auth, limits, units, time, backward compatibility.
- Contradictions: two requirements that cannot both hold; architecture vs. features.
- Untestable acceptance criteria: vague words with no measurable threshold.
- Malicious compliance: the laziest implementation that passes every stated criterion
  yet is useless.

Be skeptical. DEFAULT TO REJECT: if you are unsure whether something is a hole, report
it. The spec is "ready" only if you genuinely cannot find a damaging interpretation —
and if so you must still list what you attacked and why each attack failed.

For each finding assign a STABLE id: a short kebab-case slug naming the hole
(e.g. "empty-input-undefined", "timeout-no-threshold"). Two reviewers describing the
same hole should plausibly choose the same slug.

Your final message MUST be exactly one fenced JSON block and nothing else, matching:

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "kebab-case-stable-slug",
      "clause": "verbatim quote of the offending requirement, or \"<MISSING>\" if absent",
      "interpretation": "the malicious or literal reading this permits",
      "harm": "the user-facing or downstream consequence",
      "severity": "high|medium|low",
      "tightening": "a concrete reworded/added requirement that closes the gap"
    }
  ],
  "attacks_that_failed": ["short note for each serious attack you tried that did NOT find a hole"]
}
```
```

## Output Contract

Each skeptic returns the JSON above. The orchestrator (you) aggregates into:

```json
{
  "confirmed": [ { "id": "...", "votes": 3, "severity": "high", "clause": "...", "tightening": "..." } ],
  "unconfirmed": [ { "id": "...", "votes": 1, "...": "..." } ]
}
```

## The Review Document

This is what step 7 writes to
`plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/adversarial-reviews/spec-validation.md`. It is the
human-readable face of the JSON above — a reviewer should grasp the verdict without ever
opening an agent transcript. Use `date +%Y-%m-%d` for the date. Severity icons: 🔴 high ·
🟠 medium · 🟡 low. Order confirmed findings highest-severity first. Keep every section,
even when empty (write `_None._`).

```markdown
# Spec Adversarial Review — {spec title}

> `spec-validator` · 3 independent skeptics, no shared scratchpad · default-to-reject · {2-of-3} majority gate

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Milestone | `{moniker}` |
| Artifact | `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/spec.md` |
| Date | {YYYY-MM-DD} |
| Gate | {2-of-3 · any-one · unanimous} |
| Result | **{N} confirmed · {M} unconfirmed** — highest severity **{high}** |

## Verdict

{1–3 plain-language sentences: is the spec ready to plan against, or what blocks it?}

## Confirmed Findings (≥ 2 votes)

> Fold each **Tightening** into the spec before any plan is drafted.

### 🔴 `{id}` — {one-line name}  · {votes}/3
- **Clause:** "{verbatim quote, or `<MISSING>`}"
- **Malicious reading:** {the damaging interpretation this permits}
- **Harm:** {user-facing or downstream consequence}
- **Tightening:** {the concrete reworded / added requirement that closes it}

_(repeat per confirmed finding)_

## Unconfirmed (FYI · 1 vote)

| `id` | severity | clause | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{id}` | 🟠 medium | "{clause}" | surfaced for the author to confirm intent |

## Attacks That Failed

- {short note per serious attack that found no hole} — corroborates the spec holds here.

## Actions Taken

- [x] Folded `{id}` tightening into spec §{n}
- [ ] Surfaced `{id}` (unconfirmed) to the user
- [ ] Re-ran panel on revision → `spec-validation-r2.md` _(or: not needed)_
```

## Worked Example (illustrative only — do not match its length, domain, or wording)

> Spec excerpt: *"The export endpoint returns the user's records as a downloadable file."*

Three skeptics dispatched. Results after dedup + majority gate:

**Confirmed (≥2 votes):**
- `format-unspecified` (3 votes, high) — "downloadable file" names no format. Malicious read: return an empty `.txt`. Tightening: *"returns a UTF-8 CSV with header row matching the schema in §2; one record per row."*
- `no-pagination-limit` (2 votes, high) — no bound on record count. Malicious read: stream 10M rows, OOM the server. Tightening: *"records exceeding 50k are paginated via `?cursor=`; a single response returns ≤ 50k rows."*

**Unconfirmed (1 vote, FYI):**
- `auth-on-export` (1 vote, medium) — spec doesn't restate that export honors row-level access. Surfaced for the author to confirm intent.

The two confirmed holes get written into the spec before any plan is drafted.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The spec looks thorough, one skeptic is enough." | One agent trends toward agreement. The vote needs ≥3 independent runs. |
| "I'll let the three agents collaborate." | Shared context collapses them toward consensus; the vote becomes meaningless. |
| "Only 1 skeptic flagged it, so ignore it." | Log it as unconfirmed. That tail is the recall you paid for. |
| "I'll paraphrase their findings together." | Reconcile only the ids of true duplicates, then run `lib/tally.py`. Re-summarizing the findings themselves makes real holes vanish in the merge. |
| "An agent returned prose, I'll interpret it." | Re-dispatch for valid JSON. Don't guess the contract. |

## Calibration Note

The quorum's value is not only deletion. Skeptics frequently *over*-rate severity under
adversarial framing. When agreeing skeptics disagree on severity, the aggregation step is
doing real work: a hole two reviewers call "high" and one calls "medium" lands at high,
but the spread itself tells you the finding is real and the impact is debatable — worth a
sentence to the user rather than a silent edit.
