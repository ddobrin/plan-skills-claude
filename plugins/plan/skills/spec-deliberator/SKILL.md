name: spec-deliberator
description: Use when a drafted spec depends on knowledge that is siloed across stakeholders, documents, or repos — BEFORE adversarial validation — to improve the spec by deliberation rather than attack. Dispatches delegate agents with deliberately DISJOINT context bundles (product, engineering, ops/security) who deliberate over bounded rounds, relayed verbatim by the orchestrator, until they converge on a single jointly revised spec. Symptoms - "deliberate on this spec", "improve this spec from multiple perspectives", "get product/eng/security input on the spec", "the constraints live in different places", spec touches systems whose limits no single context window can hold, resolving the single-vote tail of a spec-validator run.

# Deliberative Spec Improvement

## Overview

Dispatch a small panel of **delegate** agents — each seeded with a *different, disjoint*
slice of the relevant knowledge — who deliberate through orchestrator-relayed dialogue
until they converge on **one jointly revised spec**. The pattern instantiates
*deliberative collaboration*: a cooperative joint decision under partial, asymmetric
observability, where dialogue exists to transport information and align beliefs
(arXiv:2607.06157).

This is the **generative** counterpart to `spec-validator`. Skeptics attack a finished
artifact independently and vote; delegates *build* the artifact together and must reach
consensus. Skeptics are forbidden to communicate; for delegates, communication is the
entire mechanism.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the spec-deliberator skill to improve this spec through a multi-perspective delegate panel."

## When to Use

- A spec draft exists but its correctness depends on constraints scattered across
  sources no single agent naturally holds: user research, infra limits, compliance
  policy, a legacy repo's real behavior.
- Stakeholder perspectives genuinely conflict and the spec must reconcile them
  (latency vs. cost, UX vs. security) rather than pick one silently.
- A `spec-validator` run left **single-vote findings** the author cannot adjudicate
  alone — deliberation over exactly that disputed tail is the highest-value hybrid
  (see **Relationship to spec-validator**).

## When NOT to Use

- **All relevant context fits comfortably in one prompt.** Merge it and revise
  centrally — a single agent with merged observations empirically beats a deliberating
  panel whenever merging is possible (the paper's centralized baseline wins by up to
  +34 normalized reward). Deliberation earns its cost only when merging is impossible
  or the contexts are genuinely siloed.
- You want defects found, not content improved — use `spec-validator`.
- No spec draft exists — brainstorm or run `product-owner` first.
- The spec is a one-liner; overhead exceeds benefit.

## Core Principle

Four things make deliberation productive instead of theater. All four are required:

1. **Engineered knowledge asymmetry** — each delegate receives a context bundle the
   others do NOT have. Apply the **asymmetry test** before dispatching: for every
   delegate, name at least one concrete fact only that delegate knows that could change
   the spec. If you cannot, you have a panel of clones — fall back to centralized
   revision.
2. **Shared artifact, forced convergence** — delegates do not produce three opinions;
   they accept or amend a single versioned proposal until all accept the same version.
   The output is one revised spec, not a survey.
3. **Bounded, verbatim-relayed dialogue** — subagents cannot talk directly, so the
   orchestrator relays the transcript. Relay utterances **verbatim, never paraphrased**:
   information degrades in transit, and lossy relaying reintroduces exactly the
   information-loss failure deliberation exists to overcome. Hard cap: **4 rounds**.
4. **Earned acceptance** — an acceptance without a stated basis is invalid. Each
   delegate accepting a proposal must say *what it verified against its private bundle*
   or *what argument changed its mind*. This is the guard against sycophantic round-1
   consensus, and it is what preserves deliberation's one empirical edge over
   centralization: reflection — a partner's challenge catching an error the author
   would have kept.

## Panel Composition

Default panel is **3 delegates** (4 max — each extra delegate adds a full turn to every
round). Choose roles so the knowledge partition is natural:

| Delegate | Typical private bundle | Typical concerns |
|---|---|---|
| **Product** | User research, support tickets, roadmap, usage stats | Who needs this, real workflows, what "done" means to a user |
| **Engineering** | Infra limits, API contracts, the actual codebase, perf budgets | Feasibility, timeouts, data shapes, migration cost |
| **Ops / Security** | Compliance policy, ACL model, audit requirements, on-call runbooks | Least privilege, failure modes, observability, data retention |

Substitute freely (e.g. swap Ops for a *Data* delegate holding schema docs, or a
*Legacy* delegate that has read the old system's source). The roles matter less than
the partition: **disjoint bundles, jointly covering everything the spec depends on**.

## Process

### 1. Gather and partition
- Collect the spec text and inventory every context source it depends on: docs,
  constraints, research, code the delegates may need to read.
- Partition the sources into 2–4 **disjoint bundles**, one per delegate. Overlap is
  tolerable (real observations overlap); identical bundles are not.
- Run the **asymmetry test** (Core Principle 1). If it fails, stop and revise
  centrally instead — say so to the user.

### 2. Author delegate prompts
Fill the template in `references/delegate-prompt.md` once per delegate, varying only the
role, the private bundle, and the concern list. That file also carries the orchestrator's
**Output Contract**.

### 3. Dispatch round 1 (sequential turns)
Turns are **sequential, not parallel** — delegate 2 must see delegate 1's utterance,
or proposals oscillate instead of converging.

- Spawn delegate 1 via the `Agent` tool with its prompt (spec + private bundle,
  empty transcript). Parse its JSON turn.
- Spawn delegate 2 with its own prompt **plus the transcript so far** (verbatim).
  Then delegate 3.
- Track `current_proposal` as a **versioned edit list** (v1, v2, …): whenever a
  delegate's turn contains amendments, apply them to produce the next version and
  record which version each delegate has accepted.
- Use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (or `"Explore"` if a bundle is "go read this
  part of the codebase").

### 4. Run subsequent rounds via SendMessage
For rounds 2+, **continue the same agents with `SendMessage`** — never respawn. A
respawned delegate loses its private reasoning context and its memory of why it
objected; continuation is what makes its stance consistent across rounds. Each
message contains only the new transcript entries since that delegate's last turn,
verbatim, plus the current proposal version.

### 5. Terminate
- **Convergence:** every delegate has accepted the *same* proposal version → done.
- **Round cap (4) reached without convergence:** the orchestrator arbitrates — adopt
  the majority position on each disputed edit, and record every unresolved dispute
  in the deliberation record for the user to decide. Never silently pick a side on a
  dispute where a delegate cited a hard constraint (a policy, a real timeout);
  escalate those to the user.
- **A delegate returns prose instead of JSON:** re-send the turn request; do not
  hand-interpret its stance.

### 6. Apply and persist
- Apply the converged edit list to produce the revised
  `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/spec.md`. Do not rewrite untouched sections.
- Write the deliberation record to
  `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/deliberations/spec-deliberation.md` (create the
  folder if needed; bare spec with no milestone → `plans/deliberations/spec-deliberation.md`
  and say so). **Always write it, even if the panel converged on "no changes"** —
  who knew what, who conceded what, and why is the audit trail. Re-runs append
  `-r2`, `-r3`, …

  Fill the template in `references/deliberation-record.md`. See
  `references/worked-example.md` for a complete run.

### 7. Hand off to validation
Deliberation is generative, not evaluative — the delegates were building, and builders
have blind spots that consensus does not cure. **Run `spec-validator` on the revised
spec** before any plan is written. The panel improving a spec is not evidence the spec
survives attack.

## Relationship to spec-validator

The two skills are inverses; use them in sequence, not as alternatives.

| | `spec-deliberator` | `spec-validator` |
|---|---|---|
| Mode | Generative — improve the spec | Evaluative — break the spec |
| Information | Partial, disjoint bundles — dialogue transports it | Partitioned by lens — each skeptic reads a different slice first; communication forbidden |
| Interaction | Multi-turn, sequential, verbatim relay | One-shot, parallel, independent |
| Convergence | Consensus on one versioned proposal | 2-of-3 majority vote on findings |
| Error control | Reflection — a partner's challenge | Statistics — uncorrelated votes |

**Pipeline:** `product-owner` (draft) → `spec-deliberator` (enrich with siloed
constraints) → `spec-validator` (attack) → fold tightenings → plan.

**The hybrid round:** after a `spec-validator` run, its *single-vote findings* are
precisely where independent judgment ran out. Convening a mini-panel (2 delegates,
2 rounds max) over only those findings — one delegate briefed to defend the spec's
intent, one holding the skeptic's finding — imports deliberation's reflection benefit
at the point of maximum uncertainty without contaminating the validator's independent
pass. Record it as `deliberations/spec-deliberation-tail.md`.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll give every delegate the full context so they're all informed." | That's a panel of clones — and a single merged-context agent beats it. Asymmetry is the entire reason to deliberate. |
| "They all accepted in round 1, great." | Round-1 unanimous acceptance with thin `acceptance_basis` is sycophancy, not consensus. Re-prompt: acceptance requires a stated verification or a changed mind. |
| "I'll summarize the transcript between turns to save tokens." | Verbatim relay is load-bearing. Paraphrase loses the exact constraint values whose transport is the point. |
| "They can keep talking until they agree." | Cap at 4 rounds. Past that, positions are entrenched; arbitrate and escalate hard-constraint disputes. |
| "I'll respawn a fresh agent each round with the transcript." | A respawn forgets its private reasoning and why it objected. Continue the same agent with SendMessage. |
| "The panel agreed, so the spec is validated." | The panel *built* it; builders share blind spots. Consensus is not adversarial survival — run `spec-validator`. |
| "More delegates, more perspectives." | Each delegate adds a turn to every round. 3 is the default, 4 the max; split bundles, not headcount. |

## Calibration Note

Deliberation is the expensive path, and the evidence says so: with mergeable context, a
centralized agent dominates (arXiv:2607.06157 finds oracle-merged baselines beat
deliberating pairs by up to +34 normalized reward, and information demonstrably degrades
in dialogue transit). What deliberation buys — the only thing it buys — is (a) access to
knowledge that *cannot* be merged, and (b) reflection: the measurable cases where a
partner's challenge corrected an error a solo agent kept. Every rule above serves one of
those two: the asymmetry test protects (a); earned acceptance, verbatim relay, and
grounded objections protect (b). When you find yourself relaxing a rule, check which of
the two you just gave up.
