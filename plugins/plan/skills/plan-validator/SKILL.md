# Adversarial Plan Validation

## Overview

Dispatch a panel of independent **skeptic** agents that assume the plan **will fail** and
race to predict exactly where and why — *before* a single task runs. Unlike spec
validation, plan skeptics **read the codebase** to check the plan's assumptions against
reality. The highest-value finding is almost always a sequencing or false-assumption bug:
"step 4 modifies a method that step 2 was supposed to create but didn't," or "the plan
says edit `X.dispatch()` but that method does not exist."

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the plan-validator skill to attack this plan with an independent skeptic panel."

## When to Use

- A written implementation plan exists (e.g. from `architect` or `superpowers:writing-plans`) and you are about to execute it.
- The user asks to "validate", "sanity-check", "stress-test", or "review" a plan before work starts.
- The plan touches existing code whose shape the plan *assumes* — exactly where plans rot.

## When NOT to Use

- The artifact is a spec (use `spec-validator`) or already-written code (use `implementation-validator`).
- A trivial one-step plan with no dependencies and no assumptions about existing code.
- No plan exists yet — write one first.

## Core Principle

Four things turn an ordinary review into adversarial findings. All four are required:

1. **Adversarial framing** — the agent assumes the plan fails and hunts for the failure, rather than judging whether it "seems reasonable."
2. **Default-to-reject** — uncertainty about whether a step is safe resolves *against* the plan. "Looks fine" is a failed review unless the agent shows what it verified.
3. **Partitioned lenses** — the three skeptics are **not** given the same prompt. Each owns a different slice of the attack surface *and* a different reading assignment (the step graph · the source files the plan names · the callers, tests and CI it disturbs). Three identical prompts on one model produce correlated errors: the panel is shaped like three votes and carries close to one.
4. **Independent quorum** — the lenses never see each other's output; keep only findings confirmed by a **majority (2 of 3)**, and rank **cross-lens** agreement above same-lens repetition.

The difference from spec stage: plan skeptics must **verify assumptions in the source**.
A predicted failure that the agent did not check against the actual code is a guess, not a
finding — the template forces them to cite `file:line`.

Never tell a skeptic to be conservative or to report only what matters. A review prompt
that asks for restraint gets restraint: the model reports *less*, and what it drops is not
reliably the noise. Recall is the skeptic's job; precision is the gate's.

## Attack Surface (what each skeptic hunts for)

- **Ordering / dependency bugs** — step N needs an artifact that step N+M produces; two steps mutate the same file with no merge plan.
- **False assumptions about existing code** — the plan names a function, file, field, table, flag, or signature that does not exist or differs. **Verify by reading the repo.**
- **Unverifiable "verify" steps** — a step that says "verify it works" with no command, test, or observable signal.
- **No rollback** — a step that cannot be undone if the next step fails (irreversible migration, deleted data, force-push).
- **Missing migration / compatibility** — schema or API change with no backfill, versioning, or backward-compat path.
- **Hidden coupling** — a "simple" edit that fans out to callers the plan never mentions.

## Process

### 1. Gather inputs
- The plan text (paste it, or give an absolute path).
- The **repository root** the agents should read — they must be able to open the files the plan touches.

### 2. Author the skeptic prompt
Fill the template in `references/skeptic-prompt.md`, which also carries the aggregation
**Output Contract**.

### 3. Run the asymmetry test, then dispatch one skeptic per lens
Before dispatching, name one finding **only that lens could reach** — lens 2 opens files
lens 1 never reads; lens 3 traces callers neither of the others visits. If you cannot name
one for a lens, merge it and run two: a panel of near-clones is worse than an honest pair,
because it manufactures false corroboration.

Then make **three `Agent` calls in a single message**, one per lens from
`references/skeptic-prompt.md` (Sequencing · Ground Truth · Blast Radius). Use
`subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (it can read and grep the codebase). Each runs
independently — no shared scratchpad.

> **Panel cost.** Review accuracy holds up well below the top model tier, so a routine
> pre-execution gate does not need the most expensive panel you can build — pass
> `model: "sonnet"` for the skeptics and reserve the default for irreversible migrations,
> security-sensitive plans, or a re-run after a material reorder. A panel cheap enough to
> run every time beats a thorough one that gets skipped. (In a `Workflow` script, the same
> lever is `effort: "low"` / `"medium"` on `agent()`; the `Agent` tool exposes `model` only.)

### 4. Collect verdicts
Parse each agent's fenced JSON. Re-dispatch any agent that returns prose instead of JSON.

### 5. Dedup by identity
Group findings by stable `id` + the `step` they target. Two skeptics describing the same
ordering bug should collapse to one entry, not three.

### 6. Apply the majority gate
- **Confirmed:** appears in **≥ 2 of 3** outputs.
- **Cross-lens vs. same-lens.** Record *which lenses* agreed. Two lenses reaching one
  finding from different evidence is independent corroboration and ranks first. A
  finding both raised by lenses that read the same material is weaker than its vote
  count suggests — read the evidence, not the tally.
- **Single vote:** appears in exactly one. These go to the **Single-Vote Findings (triage
  required)** section and each one needs an explicit decision — fixed, accepted as a known
  risk, or refuted with a reason. A lone finding from a current-generation skeptic is more
  often a real defect one reviewer happened to reach than noise, so "only one agent saw it"
  is not a reason to close it. Ordering bugs in particular are easy to miss and expensive to hit.
- Severity: most common among agreeing skeptics; tie → higher.

> **Tuning the gate:** 2-of-3 is the default. Drop to **any-one** for a high-risk plan (irreversible migrations, prod data); raise to **unanimous** when re-planning churn is costly.

### 7. Persist the review
Write the aggregated result as a Markdown report to
`plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/adversarial-reviews/plan-validation.md` (create the
folder if it does not exist). Derive `{moniker}` from the plan's path — the plan you
reviewed lives at `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/plan.md`; if you were handed a bare
plan with no milestone, write to `plans/adversarial-reviews/plan-validation.md` and say so.
**Always write this file, even on a clean pass** — "zero confirmed findings, here are the
assumptions verified" is the evidence the gate produced. A re-run after a material reorder
goes to `plan-validation-r2.md`, `-r3.md`, … so every round is preserved.

Fill the template in `references/review-template.md`. See `references/worked-example.md`
for a complete run.

### 8. Act
- For each **confirmed** finding, apply its `fix` to the plan (reorder steps, add a missing prerequisite step, add a rollback/verify step, correct an assumption).
- **Triage every single-vote finding** and record the decision in the review.
- If you reordered or added steps materially, re-run the panel once.
- Tick the **Actions Taken** checklist in the review file as you apply each fix.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Three identical prompts give me three independent opinions." | They give one opinion sampled three times. Correlated skeptics manufacture false corroboration — partition the lens *and* the reading assignment. |
| "The plan reads cleanly, it'll be fine." | Clean prose hides dead assumptions. The skeptics must open the files. |
| "The agent says step 3 is wrong but didn't cite a line." | Unverified prediction = guess. Force `file:line` or mark confidence low. |
| "One skeptic found the ordering bug, two didn't — so it's noise." | Wrong default. Modern skeptics are precise; the lone finding is usually real. Triage it and record the decision. |
| "I'll tell them to only report the serious stuff." | The model will comply and report less. Ask for everything; filter at the gate. |
| "I'll let the agents discuss the plan together." | Shared context collapses the vote. Dispatch independently. |
| "I'll merge their findings in my own words." | Dedup on stable `id` + step, or the same bug splits into three sub-quorum entries. |

## Calibration Note

Plan skeptics under adversarial framing sometimes flag a "false assumption" that is
actually correct because they grepped the wrong file or an older copy. This is why the
template demands `evidence: file:line` and a `confidence` field: a `high`-confidence
finding with a concrete line is actionable immediately; a `low`-confidence one without a
citation should be re-checked before you reorder the plan around it.

Note what the quorum is and is not for. It is a *ranking* device — it tells you which
findings two independent readers reached, and those go first. It is not a filter that makes
the rest disappear: an uncorroborated finding with a real `file:line` behind it is a
different object from an uncorroborated guess, and only the citation distinguishes them.
Read the evidence, not the vote count.
