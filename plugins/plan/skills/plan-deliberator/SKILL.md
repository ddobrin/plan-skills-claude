# Deliberative Plan Improvement

## Overview

Dispatch a small panel of **delegate** agents — each assigned a *different territory* of
the work (the spec's intent, a partition of the real codebase, the delivery pipeline) to
deep-read and speak for — who deliberate through orchestrator-relayed dialogue until they
converge on **one jointly revised plan**. The pattern instantiates *deliberative
collaboration*: a cooperative joint decision under partial, asymmetric observability,
where dialogue transports what each delegate learned in its territory (arXiv:2607.06157).

This is the **generative** counterpart to `plan-validator`. The validator's skeptics take
the plan as fixed and race to predict where it fails; deliberator delegates **reshape**
it — reorder, regroup, retarget, and above all **decide trade-offs** the plan left open
or got wrong. A validator can flag "step 4 has no rollback"; only a deliberation can
weigh an online backfill against an offline migration and commit the plan to one, with
each territory's constraints on the record.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the plan-deliberator skill to improve this plan through a multi-territory delegate panel."

## When to Use

- A written plan exists (e.g. from `architect`) and it spans more code than one agent
  can deep-read alongside the spec and the delivery constraints — the very condition
  that makes single-author plans rot.
- The plan contains an **open or contestable trade-off**: migration strategy, execution
  group boundaries, build-vs-reuse, sequencing under a deploy window, test depth vs.
  schedule.
- A `plan-validator` run left **unconfirmed 1-vote findings** that need adjudication,
  not another vote (see **Relationship to plan-validator**).

## When NOT to Use

- **The plan touches one small subsystem and everything fits one prompt.** Revise
  centrally — a single agent with merged context empirically beats a deliberating panel
  whenever merging is possible. Deliberation earns its cost only when the territories
  are too large to hold together.
- You want failure prediction on a plan you believe is finished — use `plan-validator`.
- No plan exists yet — run `architect` first; deliberation improves a draft, it does
  not replace planning.
- The artifact is a spec (use `spec-deliberator`) or code (use `implementation-validator`).

## Core Principle

Four things make deliberation productive instead of theater. All four are required:

1. **Engineered territory asymmetry** — at plan stage everything is technically readable
   by everyone, so asymmetry is created by **assigned investigation**: each delegate
   deep-reads only its territory and becomes the panel's sole authority on it. Apply the
   **asymmetry test** before dispatching: for each delegate, name one question about
   this plan that only its territory can answer (a real signature, an acceptance
   criterion, a CI constraint). If you cannot, merge the territories and revise
   centrally instead.
2. **Shared artifact, forced convergence** — delegates accept or amend a single
   versioned plan proposal until all accept the same version. The output is one revised
   `plan.md`, not three reviews.
3. **Bounded, verbatim-relayed dialogue** — the orchestrator relays the transcript
   **verbatim, never paraphrased** (a paraphrased signature or step number is exactly
   the information-loss deliberation exists to overcome). Hard cap: **4 rounds**.
4. **Evidence-grounded turns, earned acceptance** — every objection and every
   disclosure cites its territory: `file:line` for code, a quoted clause for the spec,
   a named config/command for the pipeline. An acceptance without a stated basis (what
   the delegate verified in its territory, or what argument changed its mind) is
   invalid — the guard against sycophantic round-1 consensus, and what preserves
   deliberation's empirical edge: reflection, a partner's challenge catching what the
   author would have kept.

## Panel Composition (territories)

Default panel is **3 delegates** (4 max — each extra delegate adds a full turn to every
round). Partition by territory so each has real authority:

| Delegate | Territory (deep-reads this, speaks for it) | Guards |
|---|---|---|
| **Intent** | `spec.md`, acceptance criteria, `00-ROADMAP.md`, context report | Every acceptance criterion maps to a task; no silent scope cuts; no gold-plating the spec never asked for |
| **Codebase** | The files/subsystems the plan touches — open them, trace callers, read the tests | Real signatures and shapes, hidden coupling, seams for TDD, whether execution groups truly touch disjoint files |
| **Delivery** | Build/CI config, test harness, migration tooling, deploy/rollback runbooks | Every verify-step names a runnable command; migration ordering and reversibility; group parallelism is safe in CI, not just on paper |

For a plan spanning multiple subsystems, split **Codebase** into two territory delegates
(e.g. `codebase-api`, `codebase-worker`) rather than adding new role types. The roles
matter less than the partition: **disjoint territories, jointly covering everything the
plan depends on**.

## Process

### 1. Gather and partition
- Collect the plan text, the spec it implements, and the repository root.
- List every territory the plan depends on and partition it across 2–4 delegates.
  Overlap is tolerable; identical assignments are not.
- Run the **asymmetry test** (Core Principle 1). If it fails, revise centrally and say
  so to the user.

### 2. Author delegate prompts
Fill the **Delegate Prompt Template** below once per delegate, varying the territory,
the investigation instructions, and the guard list. The "cite your territory",
"acceptance requires a basis", and "final message MUST be JSON" clauses are
load-bearing — keep them verbatim.

### 3. Dispatch round 1 (investigate, then sequential turns)
Turns are **sequential, not parallel** — delegate 2 must see delegate 1's utterance, or
proposals oscillate instead of converging.

- Spawn delegate 1 via the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (it
  must read and grep the codebase). Its first turn includes an **investigation phase**:
  deep-read the territory *before* speaking. Parse its JSON turn.
- Spawn delegate 2 with its own prompt **plus the transcript so far** (verbatim), then
  delegate 3.
- Track `current_proposal` as a **versioned plan edit list** (v1, v2, …): reorders,
  group boundary changes, inserted/removed/retargeted steps. Apply each turn's
  amendments to produce the next version; record which version each delegate accepted.

### 4. Run subsequent rounds via SendMessage
For rounds 2+, **continue the same agents with `SendMessage`** — never respawn. A
respawned delegate loses everything it read in its territory and why it objected;
continuation is what makes its authority real across rounds. Each message carries only
the new transcript entries since that delegate's last turn, verbatim, plus the current
proposal version. A delegate may investigate further mid-deliberation ("let me check
whether `schedule()` tolerates a null") — that is the pattern working, not a stall.

### 5. Terminate
- **Convergence:** every delegate has accepted the *same* proposal version → done.
- **Round cap (4) reached:** the orchestrator arbitrates — adopt the majority position
  per disputed edit and record every unresolved dispute. Never silently overrule a
  delegate citing a hard constraint (`file:line` that contradicts a step, a failing CI
  requirement, an acceptance criterion); escalate those to the user.
- **Prose instead of JSON:** re-send the turn request; never hand-interpret a stance.

### 6. Apply and persist
- Apply the converged edit list to produce the revised
  `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/plan.md`. Preserve the plan's structure (parallel
  execution groups, per-task test steps) — deliberation edits the plan, it does not
  reformat it.
- Write the deliberation record to
  `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/deliberations/plan-deliberation.md` (create the
  folder if needed; bare plan with no milestone → `plans/deliberations/plan-deliberation.md`
  and say so). **Always write it, even if the panel converged on "no changes"** — who
  investigated what, which trade-off was decided on which evidence, is the audit trail.
  Re-runs append `-r2`, `-r3`, … Fill the **Deliberation Record** template verbatim.

### 7. Hand off to validation
Deliberation is generative, not evaluative — the delegates were reshaping, and a panel
that just negotiated a trade-off is invested in it. **Run `plan-validator` on the
revised plan** before execution. Consensus is not adversarial survival.

## Delegate Prompt Template

Dispatch once per delegate via the `Agent` tool. Replace `{ROLE}`, `{TERRITORY}`,
`{GUARDS}`, `{PLAN}`, `{SPEC_PATH}`, `{REPO_ROOT}`, `{TRANSCRIPT}`, `{CURRENT_PROPOSAL}`.

```
You are the {ROLE} delegate on a plan deliberation panel. The panel's shared goal is ONE
revised implementation plan every delegate can accept. You share the reward: a plan that
fails in execution fails for all of you, whichever delegate's territory hid the cause.

YOUR TERRITORY (deep-read this BEFORE your first utterance; you are the panel's only
authority on it — no other delegate will read it):
{TERRITORY}

YOUR GUARDS: {GUARDS}

PLAN UNDER DELIBERATION:
{PLAN}

SPEC IT IMPLEMENTS: {SPEC_PATH}
REPOSITORY ROOT: {REPO_ROOT}

TRANSCRIPT SO FAR (verbatim, may be empty in round 1):
{TRANSCRIPT}

CURRENT PROPOSAL: version {v}, edits: {CURRENT_PROPOSAL}

Rules of deliberation:
- Investigate first, speak second. Every claim about your territory cites evidence:
  file:line for code, a quoted clause for the spec, a named command/config for the
  pipeline. An uncited claim is a guess and wastes the panel's round budget.
- Surface every territory fact that should change the plan — an undisclosed constraint
  is a defect you caused.
- Challenge proposals that contradict your territory; concede points outside it.
- When the plan leaves a trade-off open (migration strategy, group boundaries,
  build-vs-reuse), state your territory's position AND its cost, so the panel can
  decide with all constraints on the record.
- Do not concede to end the conversation. Accept ONLY if the proposal is consistent
  with everything you verified, and state your acceptance basis: what you checked, or
  what argument changed your mind.
- Propose amendments as concrete plan edits (reorder, insert step, retarget name,
  split/merge group), not sentiments.

Your final message MUST be exactly one fenced JSON block and nothing else, matching:

```json
{
  "utterance": "what you say to the panel this turn — arguments, disclosures, reactions",
  "disclosures": [
    { "fact": "territory fact introduced into the record", "evidence": "file:line | spec clause | command/config" }
  ],
  "amendments": [
    {
      "target": "step number / group / section of the plan",
      "edit": "the concrete change: reorder, insert, remove, retarget, regroup",
      "reason": "the cited territory fact or transcript argument motivating it"
    }
  ],
  "stance": "accept|amend|object",
  "acceptance_basis": "REQUIRED when stance is accept: what you verified in your territory, or what changed your mind. Empty otherwise."
}
```
```

## Output Contract

Each turn returns the JSON above. The orchestrator (you) maintains:

```json
{
  "proposal_versions": [ { "version": 2, "edits": ["..."], "produced_by": "codebase, round 1" } ],
  "acceptances": { "intent": 2, "codebase": 2, "delivery": 1 },
  "tradeoffs_decided": [ { "topic": "...", "chosen": "...", "over": "...", "because": "each territory's constraint, cited" } ],
  "disputes": [ { "topic": "...", "positions": {"intent": "...", "delivery": "..."}, "resolution": "converged v2 | escalated" } ]
}
```

Convergence = all delegates' accepted version equals the latest version.

## The Deliberation Record

Written in step 6 to `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/deliberations/plan-deliberation.md`.
A reader should understand what changed in the plan and *which territory's evidence forced
it* without opening any transcript. Use `date +%Y-%m-%d` for the date. Keep every
section, even when empty (write `_None._`).

```markdown
# Plan Deliberation — {plan title}

> `plan-deliberator` · {N} delegates with disjoint territories · evidence-grounded turns · verbatim relay · {R} rounds to convergence

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Milestone | `{moniker}` |
| Artifact | `plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/plan.md` |
| Date | {YYYY-MM-DD} |
| Panel | {intent · codebase · delivery} |
| Outcome | **{converged on v{n} · arbitrated · escalated}** — {K} edits applied, {T} trade-offs decided |

## Verdict

{1–3 sentences: what materially changed in the plan and which territory's evidence drove
the biggest change or decided the central trade-off.}

## Panel & Territories

| Delegate | Territory (what it deep-read) | Key disclosure (with evidence) |
|---|---|---|
| codebase | {files/subsystems} | {the fact that mattered} — `{file:line}` |

## Trade-offs Decided

### {topic}
- **Chosen:** {option} — **over** {rejected option}
- **Because:** {each territory's constraint, cited}
- **Accepted by:** all, round {r}

## Edits Applied (converged proposal v{n})

### {target: step/group} — {one-line description}
- **Before:** "{original step/ordering, or `<ABSENT>`}"
- **After:** "{revised}"
- **Driven by:** {delegate} — {cited territory fact}
- **Accepted by:** all, round {r} _(bases: {one clause per delegate})_

_(repeat per edit)_

## Disputes

| Topic | Positions | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| {topic} | intent: {…} / delivery: {…} | {converged v{n} · arbitrated (majority) · 🛑 escalated to user} |

## Round Log

- **R1:** {one line per delegate: investigated X, disclosed Y, proposed/objected Z}
- **R2:** {…}

## Handoff

- [ ] Revised plan written to `plan.md` (structure preserved: groups, test-first steps)
- [ ] `plan-validator` run on the revision → `adversarial-reviews/plan-validation.md`
- [ ] Escalated disputes decided by user _(or: none)_
```

## Relationship to plan-validator

The two skills are inverses; use them in sequence, not as alternatives.

| | `plan-deliberator` | `plan-validator` |
|---|---|---|
| Mode | Generative — reshape the plan, decide trade-offs | Evaluative — predict where the fixed plan fails |
| Information | Partial by assignment — each delegate deep-reads one territory | Complete — every skeptic may read anything |
| Interaction | Multi-turn, sequential, verbatim relay | One-shot, parallel, independent |
| Convergence | Consensus on one versioned proposal | 2-of-3 majority vote on findings |
| Error control | Reflection — a partner's cited challenge | Statistics — uncorrelated votes + `file:line` evidence |
| Can it decide "online backfill vs offline migration"? | Yes — that is its job | No — it can only flag the absence of a decision |

**Pipeline:** `architect` (draft plan) → `plan-deliberator` (reshape with territory
evidence, decide trade-offs) → `plan-validator` (attack) → fold fixes → 🛑 human gate →
execute.

**The hybrid round:** after a `plan-validator` run, its *unconfirmed 1-vote findings*
are where independent judgment ran out. Convene a mini-panel (2 delegates, 2 rounds
max) over only those findings — one delegate briefed to defend the plan's approach, one
assigned the territory the finding concerns, both citing evidence. Record it as
`deliberations/plan-deliberation-tail.md`.

## Worked Example (illustrative only — do not match its length, domain, or wording)

> Plan excerpt (from `architect`): *"Step 2: add `retryCount` to the `Job` record.
> Step 3: update `JobScheduler.dispatch()` to read `retryCount`. Step 4: migrate
> existing rows. Groups: {2,3} parallel with {4}."*

Territories: **intent** deep-reads the spec (acceptance criterion: *"failed jobs retry
≤ 3 times; retries visible in the ops dashboard"*), **codebase** deep-reads
`scheduler/` and `dashboard/`, **delivery** reads CI config and migration tooling.

- **R1 — codebase** discloses: no `dispatch()` exists — the method is `schedule(Job)`
  (`scheduler/JobScheduler.java:88`); also legacy rows have no `retryCount`, and
  `schedule()` NPEs on null fields (`:104`). Amends: retarget step 3; the plan needs a
  default *before* step 3 (v1).
- **R1 — intent** objects to the plan's scope, citing the criterion: retries must be
  *visible in the dashboard* — no step touches `dashboard/`. Amends: add step 5,
  dashboard column + test (v2).
- **R1 — delivery** discloses: there is no maintenance window before the release
  (`deploy/RELEASES.md`), so an offline migration in step 4 cannot run; states the
  trade-off: offline migration (simpler, needs window) vs. online default + lazy
  backfill (no window, more code). Proposes online: step 2b "default `retryCount` to
  0", step 4 becomes lazy backfill, groups reordered — {2, 2b} → {3, 5} ∥ {4} (v3).
- **R2 — codebase** accepts v3 (basis: verified `schedule()` handles default 0,
  `:104`); **intent** accepts v3 (basis: criterion now maps to steps 3+5); **delivery**
  accepts its own v3. **Converged, v3, 2 rounds. Trade-off decided: online backfill,
  because no-window + null-intolerant scheduler.**

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll let every delegate read the whole repo so they're all informed." | Then no one is the authority on anything and you have three shallow generalists — a single merged-context agent beats that. Assign territories. |
| "They all accepted in round 1, great." | Round-1 unanimity with thin `acceptance_basis` is sycophancy. Re-prompt: acceptance requires cited verification or a changed mind. |
| "A delegate asserted `dispatch()` doesn't exist but cited nothing." | Uncited territory claims are guesses. Send it back for `file:line` before the panel reacts to it. |
| "I'll summarize the transcript between turns." | Verbatim relay is load-bearing — a paraphrased signature or step number corrupts exactly what deliberation transports. |
| "They can keep talking until they agree." | Cap at 4 rounds; arbitrate, escalate hard-evidence disputes to the user. |
| "I'll respawn fresh agents each round with the transcript." | A respawn forgets everything it read in its territory. Continue the same agents with SendMessage. |
| "The panel agreed, so skip plan-validator." | The panel is invested in the trade-off it just negotiated. Consensus is not adversarial survival — run the validator. |
| "More delegates, more coverage." | Each delegate adds a turn to every round. Split territories across 3 (max 4); never add headcount without a disjoint territory to assign. |

## Calibration Note

Deliberation is the expensive path, and the evidence says so: with mergeable context, a
centralized agent dominates (arXiv:2607.06157 — oracle-merged baselines beat
deliberating panels by up to +34 normalized reward, and information demonstrably
degrades in dialogue transit). What deliberation buys at plan stage is (a) **depth per
territory** — three delegates can each *actually read* their subsystem where one agent
skims all three, and (b) **decided trade-offs with constraints on the record** — the
one thing a validator structurally cannot produce. Every rule above serves one of
those: the asymmetry test and territory assignment protect (a); evidence-grounded
turns, earned acceptance, and verbatim relay protect (b). When you relax a rule, check
which one you just gave up — and remember the panel's consensus is a *draft decision*,
not a verdict: the verdict belongs to `plan-validator` and the human gate.
