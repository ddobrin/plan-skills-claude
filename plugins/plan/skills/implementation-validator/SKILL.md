description: Use after code is written and before merge, to confirm the implementation actually does what it claims. Dispatches independent skeptic agents that read the diff and surrounding code with a default-to-reject posture, hunt for real defects (or refute explicit acceptance claims), and assign a corrected severity — keeping only findings confirmed by a 2-of-3 majority. Symptoms - "validate this implementation", "did this actually work", "review this diff adversarially", "verify these findings are real", after completing a feature/task, before merging to main.

# Adversarial Implementation Validation

## Overview

Dispatch a panel of independent **skeptic** agents that read a diff (and the code around
it) trying to **break** the implementation, not bless it. This is the stage where
adversarial verification earns its keep twice over: it culls plausible-but-wrong findings,
**and** it *calibrates severity* — a defect three reviewers agree is real may still be
over-rated, and the corrected severity is part of the output.

Two modes, same machinery:

- **Finding-hunt (default):** each skeptic independently hunts the diff for defects with a default-to-reject posture. Best when you want "what's broken in this change."
- **Claim-refutation (variant):** you supply explicit acceptance claims (e.g. from the spec's acceptance criteria) and each skeptic tries to *refute* each one. Best when you have a checklist the code must satisfy.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the implementation-validator skill to attack this diff with an independent skeptic panel."

## When to Use

- A change is complete (a diff, a finished task, a feature branch) and you want it validated before merge.
- The user asks to "validate", "verify", "adversarially review", or "confirm" an implementation.
- You already have candidate findings (from a prior reviewer) and want them adversarially verified before acting.

## When NOT to Use

- The artifact is a spec (use `spec-validator`) or a plan (use `plan-validator`).
- A trivial diff (typo, comment, version bump) — overhead exceeds benefit.
- You need to confirm the app *runs* end-to-end — that is the auditor's dynamic check; this skill reasons about the code, it does not launch the app.

## Core Principle

Three things turn an ordinary review into adversarial findings. All three are required:

1. **Adversarial framing** — the agent's job is to construct the input or sequence that breaks the code, not to judge whether it "looks good."
2. **Default-to-reject** — for finding-hunt, default `isReal=false` (only confirmed, code-grounded defects count). For claim-refutation, default `refuted=true` (a claim survives only if the agent actively tried and failed to break it).
3. **Independent quorum** — run **N = 3** skeptics that never see each other's output, then keep only findings confirmed by a **majority (2 of 3)**.

## Attack Surface (what each skeptic hunts for)

- **Claim vs. reality** — the code does not actually do what the diff/PR/commit message says.
- **Failure paths** — the happy path works but the error/empty/timeout path is broken or swallows errors silently.
- **Edge cases** — empty, null, zero, negative, huge, duplicate, unicode, boundary-off-by-one inputs.
- **Concurrency** — shared mutable state on a singleton/shared instance, non-atomic read-modify-write, races across requests (see Calibration Note — this is the classic over-rated category).
- **Resource / correctness** — leaks, unbounded growth, incorrect math, wrong comparison, lost precision.
- **Regression** — a caller or contract the diff silently broke.

## Process

### 1. Gather inputs
- The diff range: `BASE_SHA` and `HEAD_SHA` (so agents can run `git diff {BASE}..{HEAD}`).
- A one-line description of what the change *claims* to do.
- For claim-refutation mode: the explicit list of acceptance claims.

Get the SHAs:
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse origin/main)   # or HEAD~1, or the branch point
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

### 2. Author the skeptic prompt
Pick **Finding-Hunt Template** or **Claim-Refutation Template** below. Keep the
default-to-reject and "final message MUST be JSON" clauses verbatim.

### 3. Dispatch 3 skeptics in parallel
Make **three `Agent` calls in a single message**, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
(it can run `git diff` and read files). Independent runs, no shared scratchpad.

> **Perspective-diverse variant:** instead of three identical skeptics, give each a distinct lens — e.g. one `correctness`, one `concurrency`, one `failure-paths`. Diversity catches failure modes that three identical refuters would all miss together. Then the "majority" becomes "≥2 lenses independently land on the same defect."

### 4. Collect verdicts
Parse each agent's fenced JSON. Re-dispatch any agent that returns prose.

### 5–6. Dedup, gate, and calibrate
Save each skeptic's JSON to a file. In finding-hunt mode, skeptics name the same defect
with different slugs and path spellings, and `tally.py` groups on the exact `file` + `id`,
so first reconcile: where two findings describe the same defect (same file:line, same
failure) under different slugs or path spellings, rewrite them to one canonical `file` and
`id` in the saved files and record each remapping for the review. Merge only true
duplicates. Then run
`python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/tally.py --gate 2 s1.json s2.json s3.json`.
Finding-hunt: it counts only `isReal=true` votes per `file` + `id` and takes the majority
`correctedSeverity` (tie → higher). Claim-refutation: pass the per-claim verdict files
instead; a claim fails when `refuted=true` reaches the gate and survives when
`refuted=false` does. Read the confirmed, failed, and unconfirmed lists from its output
rather than counting yourself. Use `--gate 1` for security-critical changes and `--gate 3` when
fix-churn is expensive.

### 7. Persist the review
Write the aggregated result as a Markdown report to
`plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/adversarial-reviews/implementation-validation.md`
(create the folder if it does not exist). `{moniker}` is the active milestone whose
`plan.md`/`spec.md` this diff implements — the orchestrator knows it; if the diff belongs
to no milestone, write to `plans/adversarial-reviews/implementation-validation.md` and say
so. **Always write this file, even on a clean pass** — "zero confirmed defects, here is
what was attacked" is the evidence the gate produced, and the **severity calibration**
table is the highest-value thing this stage emits. A re-validation after fixes goes to
`implementation-validation-r2.md`, `-r3.md`, … so each round is preserved. Fill the **The
Review Document** template below verbatim.

### 8. Act
- Fix **confirmed** defects (and **failed claims**) at their calibrated severity, highest first.
- Surface **unconfirmed** findings for human eyeballing.
- Report the calibration explicitly: claimed = the highest single-skeptic rating in tally's `severity_votes` (or a prior reviewer's rating when validating existing findings); corrected = tally's majority. Say what moved and why, or that nothing moved. See Calibration Note.
- Tick the **Actions Taken** checklist in the review file as you fix each defect.

## Finding-Hunt Template (default)

Dispatch **three times, unchanged**. Replace `{DESCRIPTION}`, `{BASE_SHA}`, `{HEAD_SHA}`.

```
You are an adversarial implementation verifier. Your job is to BREAK this change, not to
approve it. Read the diff and the surrounding code, then construct the inputs or sequences
that make it misbehave.

WHAT THE CHANGE CLAIMS TO DO:
{DESCRIPTION}

DIFF TO ATTACK:
  git diff --stat {BASE_SHA}..{HEAD_SHA}
  git diff {BASE_SHA}..{HEAD_SHA}
Read any file in the repo you need to understand the blast radius.

Hunt across these categories:
- Claim vs. reality: the code does not actually do what it claims.
- Failure paths: error/empty/timeout path broken or silently swallowing errors.
- Edge cases: empty, null, zero, negative, huge, duplicate, unicode, off-by-one.
- Concurrency: shared mutable state, non-atomic read-modify-write, cross-request races.
- Resource/correctness: leaks, unbounded growth, wrong math/comparison, lost precision.
- Regression: a caller or contract the diff silently broke.

Be skeptical. DEFAULT isReal=false: report a finding as real ONLY if you can ground it in
the actual code. If a concern is purely stylistic, cannot be confirmed in the source, or
relies on a misreading, set isReal=false and say why.

Assign each finding a STABLE id: a short kebab-case slug (e.g. "empty-list-npe",
"singleton-cursor-race"). Two reviewers finding the same defect should plausibly choose
the same slug. Calibrate severity against these definitions: critical = unconditional data loss/corruption
or broken core function on every run; high = serious but conditional (e.g. only under
concurrency); medium = real but narrow; low = minor.

Your final message MUST be exactly one fenced JSON block and nothing else, matching:

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "kebab-case-stable-slug",
      "title": "short description of the defect",
      "file": "path relative to repo root",
      "location": "line number(s) or method/class",
      "isReal": true,
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "correctedSeverity": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "attack": "the input/sequence/edge case that triggers it",
      "evidence": "file:line and the specific code that proves it",
      "reasoning": "why it breaks (or, if isReal=false, why it does not)",
      "fix": "concrete remediation"
    }
  ],
  "attacks_that_failed": ["short note for each serious attack that did NOT find a defect"]
}
```
```

## Claim-Refutation Template (variant)

When you have explicit acceptance claims, dispatch this **three times per claim**
(or once with the full claim list). Replace `{CLAIM}`, `{DESCRIPTION}`, `{BASE_SHA}`, `{HEAD_SHA}`.

```
You are an adversarial verifier. The implementer claims:

  "{CLAIM}"

Your job is to REFUTE this claim. Read the diff (git diff {BASE_SHA}..{HEAD_SHA}) and the
surrounding code, then construct the input, sequence, or edge case that makes the claim
false. Consider the failure path, not just the happy path; consider concurrency and
boundary inputs.

CONTEXT — what the change claims overall:
{DESCRIPTION}

Be skeptical. DEFAULT refuted=true. Return refuted=false only if you tried to break the claim
and could not, and describe what you tried.

Your final message MUST be exactly one fenced JSON block and nothing else, matching:

```json
{
  "claim": "the claim verbatim",
  "refuted": true,
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "correctedSeverity": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "attack": "the input/sequence you used to break it (or tried, if not refuted)",
  "evidence": "file:line proving the refutation (or proving robustness)",
  "reasoning": "why the claim fails or holds, citing the actual code"
}
```
```

## Output Contract

The orchestrator aggregates skeptic JSON into:

```json
{
  "confirmed":   [ { "id": "...", "votes": 2, "file": "...", "location": "...", "severity": "high", "fix": "..." } ],
  "unconfirmed": [ { "id": "...", "votes": 1, "...": "..." } ],
  "failed_claims": [ { "claim": "...", "refuted_by": 2, "severity": "high" } ],
  "calibration": [ { "id": "...", "claimedSeverity": "critical", "correctedSeverity": "high", "why": "conditional on concurrency" } ]
}
```

## The Review Document

This is what step 7 writes to
`plans/active_milestones/{moniker}/adversarial-reviews/implementation-validation.md`. It is
the human-readable face of the JSON above — a reviewer should grasp what is broken, at what
*corrected* severity, without opening an agent transcript. Use `date +%Y-%m-%d` for the
date. Severity icons: 🔴 critical · 🟠 high · 🟡 medium · ⚪ low. The **Severity
Calibration** table is the centerpiece — never omit it when any severity was revised. Drop
the **Failed Claims** section in finding-hunt mode. Keep the other sections even when empty
(write `_None._`).

```markdown
# Implementation Adversarial Review — {change title}

> `implementation-validator` · 3 independent skeptics, no shared scratchpad · default-to-reject (`isReal=false` / `refuted=true`) · {2-of-3} majority gate · severity calibration

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Milestone | `{moniker}` |
| Diff | `{BASE_SHA}..{HEAD_SHA}` |
| Date | {YYYY-MM-DD} |
| Mode | {finding-hunt · claim-refutation} |
| Gate | {2-of-3 · any-one · unanimous} |
| Result | **{N} confirmed defects · {F} failed claims · {M} unconfirmed** — highest corrected severity **{high}** |

## Verdict

{1–3 plain-language sentences. Lead with the calibration headline — what moved between claimed and corrected severity and why — or state that nothing moved.}

## Confirmed Defects (≥ 2 votes)

> Fix at the **corrected** severity, highest first.

### 🔴 `{id}` — {one-line title}  · severity {high} · {votes}/3
- **Location:** `{file}:{location}`
- **Attack:** {the input / sequence / edge case that triggers it}
- **Evidence:** `{file:line}` — {the specific code that proves it}
- **Why it breaks:** {reasoning}
- **Fix:** {concrete remediation}

_(repeat per confirmed defect)_

## Severity Calibration

| `id` | claimed | corrected | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{id}` | {highest single rating} | {tally majority} | {why the impact is narrower or wider} |

## Failed Claims  _(claim-refutation mode only)_

| claim | refuted by | severity | attack |
|---|---|---|---|
| "{claim}" | {2}/3 | 🟠 high | {input that falsified it} |

## Unconfirmed (FYI · 1 vote)

| `id` | severity | location | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{id}` | ⚪ low | `{file}:{loc}` | surfaced, not blocking |

## Attacks That Failed

- {short note per serious attack that found no defect} — corroborates robustness here.

## Actions Taken

- [x] Fixed `{id}` at {corrected severity}
- [ ] Surfaced calibration delta to user: "{the headline sentence}"
- [ ] Re-validated after fixes → `implementation-validation-r2.md` _(or: not needed)_
```

## Worked Example (illustrative only — do not match its length, domain, or wording)

> Change claims: *"Planner walks precompiled steps; safe under concurrent deliberations."*
> Finding-hunt, 3 skeptics over `git diff origin/main..HEAD`.

After dedup + majority gate + calibration:

**Confirmed (≥2 votes):**
- `singleton-cursor-race` (3 votes) — claimed **critical** by the skeptics, **corrected to high**. The planner is a shared singleton with non-volatile `cursor`/`steps` instance fields mutated per run (`Planner.java:59-64`, non-atomic `cursor++` at `:306`). One verifier narrowed it: intra-request replan is serialized, so the race is **strictly cross-request**, not within one deliberation — which is why "critical" (implying unconditional corruption) was an overstatement. Fix: make planner request-scoped or move per-run state out of the bean.

**Unconfirmed (1 vote, FYI):**
- `objectmapper-dup` (1 vote, low) — duplicated `ObjectMapper`/serialization. Surfaced, not blocking.

**Calibration reported to the user:** *"1 finding claimed Critical; confirmed real by all 3 skeptics but downgraded to High — impact is gated on concurrent requests, not every run."*

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The diff is small, one reviewer is enough." | Small diffs hide concurrency and failure-path bugs. Run the panel. |
| "All three rated it Critical, so it's Critical." | Check the *corrected* severity and the reasoning — adversarial framing over-rates. Calibration is the point. |
| "One skeptic flagged a race, two didn't." | Concurrency bugs are easy to miss. Keep it unconfirmed and look at the evidence. |
| "I'll tally findings by their titles." | Titles and slugs differ across agents. Reconcile duplicate ids and path spellings, then run `lib/tally.py`, which counts by `file` + `id`. |
| "The agent said it's broken — fix it." | Read the cited `evidence` first. A finding without a real `file:line` is a guess, not a defect. |
| "I verified the code, so the feature works." | This skill reasons about code; it does not run the app. For runtime confirmation, do a manual `verify` pass too. |

## Calibration Note

The highest-value output of this stage is **severity calibration, not deletion**.
Adversarial framing over-rates: a defect that is real but conditional (for example a
cross-request race, not corruption on every call) is High, not Critical. Always surface
the calibration delta to the user; it is more decision-useful than the raw verdict.
